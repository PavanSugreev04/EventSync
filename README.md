<p id="description">Event Sync is a collaborative project aimed at creating a user-friendly event-finding application for college students. This app allows users to search for upcoming events and nearby breweries, using APIs like Ticketmaster and Open Brewery for data. Itâ€™s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring responsive design and dynamic content updates.</p>

<h2>ðŸš€ Demo</h2>
(https://event-sync-nine.vercel.app)

## Feature List:

* User can see the top five events list.
* User can view the details about date, time, and venue.
* User can view local breweries on a map with links to the breweries.
* User have direct access to make a purchase

## Resources:

- For css styling, the application uses [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction).
- To format date and time, the application uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library.
- For additional fonts, the application uses [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) and [GoogleFonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts).

#### APIs list:
* [Ticketmaster](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/)
* [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation/01-listbreweries)
* [Google Maps Static API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/overview)

The local storage is used here to store previous searched events up to three. If any non-related name is searched, it will notify the user. For a convenient and clear look, we have made the UI simple and attractive with appripriate css style and google fonts.
